  		<h1> Some Ol' Fashioned Roshambo! </h1>
  		
  		<p> Welcome to Roshambo! Better known as rock, paper, scissors; Today you will be competing against your greatest competitor yet! That's right, a computer.

    <!-- How can we make this interactive? BUTTONS. I want to create a start button. Then that will show the different interactive buttons (rock/paper/scissor) or maybe when you click start, it will just jump down the webpage (this is easier) where the game is.  -->
    <div>
    	
    	<!-- <p id="demo">Start!</p> --> 
    	<button class="rock" type="button" value="rock" onclick="pickRock(1,3)"> 
    		<img id="rock" src="C:\Users\jd144\OneDrive\Documents\test-suite\rocks.png" alt="rock" width="150" height="150">
    	</button>

    	<button class="paper" type="button" value="paper" onclick="pickPaper(1,3)"> 
    		<img id="paper" src="C:\Users\jd144\OneDrive\Documents\test-suite\plane.png" alt="paper" width="150" height="150">
    	</button>

    	<button class="scissor" type="button" value="scissor" onclick="pickScissor(1,3)"> 
    		<img id="scissor" src="C:\Users\jd144\OneDrive\Documents\test-suite\scissor.png" alt="scissor" width="150" height="150">
    	</button>

    </div>

    <!-- After the start button: we need 3 pictures (icons?) (flaticons?) of rock/paper/scissor). Tell the person viewing the webpage: "Choose wisely!"--> 
  

    <!-- following the click, I will need to run some JavaScript --> 
    <!-- Insert JavaScript here?
    How do we get the computer to make a selection of rock paper or scissor?
    Under the hood: chooses a number between 1 to 3, assign rock paper or scissor to each of the numbers. After the number is chosen  => run the conditionals to check who won. If statements? Switch? -->

    <!-- Run the result, and log the result to the screen.  -->

    <!-- future idea: a counter at the bottom which keep tracks off the current screen's win/loss? --> 

    <!-- A play again button that resets the game -->  

    <!-- link to a quick survey about how to improve the game; Fine tuned to Dan --> 





    <!-- is this too complicated for a one day project -->
